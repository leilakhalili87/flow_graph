# English Recipe Flow Graph

This set of codes wil produce a flow graph for a custom English recipe. 

# Folders
    1) ./data/list: The manually  annotated recipes in the form of *.list files
    2) ./data/flow: The manually edge labels  of the recipes in the form of *.flow files
    3) ./data/output/train: The feature vector for all pairs of annotated words in the training recipes 
                     are saved in this path.
    4) ./data/output/test: The feature vector for all pairs of annotated words in the test recipes 
                     are saved in this path.    

# Input
    1) Please odwnload the universal sentence encoder using
       !mkdir ../sentence_wise_email/module/module_useT
       Download the module, and uncompress it to the destination folder. 
       !curl -L "https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder-large/3?tf-hub-format=compressed" | tar -zxvC ../sentence_wise_email/module/module_useT

# Running the code for flow graphs with edged labels
    1) python main_use.py   
    2) pyhton cal_s.py   

# Running the code for flow graphs without edged labels
    1) python main_use.py   
    2) pyhton cal_s_wo_label.py      

# For producing the data n Example one change line 26 in cal_s.py to "name_test_file = 'test'" 
# For producing the data n Example two change line 26 in cal_s.py to "name_test_file = 'sample'"
